## Contributing

This site is built with [VuePress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/). Site content is written in Markdown format located in `src`. For simple edits, you can directly edit the file on GitHub and generate a Pull Request.

For local development, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is preferred as package manager:

```bash
yarn
docs:dev
```

This project requires Node.js to be `v14.0.0` or higher, because we use new JavaScript features in our code, such as optional chaining.

## Working on the content

- [Daring Fireball: Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- See VuePress docs on supported [Markdown Extensions](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html).
